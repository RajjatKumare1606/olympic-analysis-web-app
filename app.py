                    ######  The Olympic Games is a well-known sporting platform which is recognized all over the world, has been distinguished from the late 19th century. Its origin however can be traced back to the Greek empire, at around 3,000 years ago, which consisted only of sprint race, and was held in Greece‚Äôs city Olympia only accessible to freeborn Greek people (Young & Abraham, 2020). It has grown since then and now has become a hub for all the athletes worldwide to demonstrate their abilities in more than 28 individual sporting contests. Currently, it is held every 2 years in different countries, with names Summer Olympics and Winter Olympics, both having their own set of games (Young & Abraham, 2020). It has become a place which reflects the power of the individual contestants and has become a source of pride for the countries they represent.
                    ### Motivation and Research Question
                    ###### Olympics has a rich history, spanning from 1896 till 2018, and has been a part of history. So, it is an interesting topic to see how the historical events have affected the specifics of Olympics and how it has been changing till date. Hence, this report attempts to build around the following questions, with some connection to historical happenings where suitable:
                    - 1. What effect does the host country have in the medals won at the Olympics?
                    - 2. Is the age of winning Olympics changing?
                    - 3. How many countries were participated in this event?
                    - 4. Overall Medal Tally

                        The advantage of host country in any sporting activity is well known, as the participants will have familiarity of the field, and also there is a great support from the home crowd. Host countries are expected to win 3 times the medals that they were winning while playing as away (Clarke, 2000). Being a host nation and also having a communist background is also going to have a positive effect in the number of medals won (Bian, 2005).
                        It is found that a country‚Äôs socio-economic variables, such as GDP affects the country‚Äôs performance in the Olympics by a great factor. Country‚Äôs population and its GDP is seen to have a correlation with the number of medals won in Olympics (Bian, 2005).
                        Age factor is also one of the important ones when it comes to sports and even among the athletes of the same age, relative age effect (RAE) comes into factor which determines who triumphs (Fletcher & Sarkar, 2012). RAE states that an athlete can have more advantage as compared to another who is younger by almost a year with respect to maturity, experience and early specialization (Neill, Cotton, Cuadros & Connor, 2016).
                        Olympics has been part of the history, and has affected, and also has been affected by the history. 
                        Olympic Games has made major social and political impacts throughout the history like including women in sports, has taken a stand against racial matters, promoted civil rights, has unified countries and even has been a tool to demonstrate power by different countries (O‚ÄôConnell). Similarly, the politics of the countries such as racial separation, terrorism, World Wars and the Cold War have also affected Olympics at different times in the history (Dwyer & McMaster, 2018).

                    To answer the questions, three datasets were used namely, ‚Äú120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results[1]‚Äù, ‚ÄúGapminder GDP per capita, constant PPP dollars- v25[2]‚Äù and ‚ÄúGapminder Total Population v6[3]‚Äù. 
                    The Olympics dataset had the names of participants, their demographics, which sport they participated in and on which Olympic games. Gapminder‚Äôs GDP per capita dataset consisted of GDP of countries from 1960 forecasted till 2040, and their Population dataset had populations of all the countries of the world from 1800 till 2019 and forecasted from there onwards till 2100. 
                    A custom dataset was also created that maps the cities mentioned in the Olympics dataset to country names.
                    Visualizations were created in Tableau and Python. Initial data cleaning was done on Excel, and visualization specific data manipulation were carried out as needed on Python.

                        It is clear that the host countries have always a better chance of winning medals in the Olympics; 
                        they can win at least 10‚Äì20 percent more medals. 
                        Looking at the economic effect, even though country‚Äôs population and per capita GDP affected the number of medals won in the past, the total GDP of the country is more significant to determine the winnings in the recent years. 
                        With the age factor, the age range of players winning medals has decreased over the years, and an optimal age for each sport can be identified in the recent years. 
                        Thus, there is a high chance for an athlete from a host country with high GDP, whose age range falls in the optimum age range for the sport to win a medal in the Olympics.
